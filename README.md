# Combine-Txt-Files
A Python script that merges multiple .txt files in the same folder into a single file. Each file's content is preserved with its original formatting. Simply place the script in a folder with the .txt files, double-click to run, and it will automatically create a combined output file in that folder.

## Features

- Automatically merges all `.txt` files in the folder.
- Maintains original formatting of each file.
- Adds a single blank line between the contents of each file.
- Simple to use: no configuration or path editing needed.

## How to Use

1. Download or clone this repository to your machine.
2. Place the script (`combine_txt_files.py`) in the folder containing your `.txt` files.
3. Double-click the script to run it.
4. The combined output will be saved as `combined_code.txt` in the same folder.

## Example

If you have the following `.txt` files in the folder:

- `file1.txt`
- `file2.txt`
- `file3.txt`

Running the script will generate a `combined_code.txt` file, which will contain the content of each file, separated by a blank line.
